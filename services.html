							<h2>What's a College Preparatory Analysis?</h2>
							  <p style="color: #000000; line-height: 2;">

            Our free 30 minute College Preparatory Analysis (CPA) is a personalized survey conducted by a Ridgefield associate to assess a student’s current academic standing, goals, skills, and plans for the future. Within 2–3 days, we review the information to identify strengths, areas for improvement, and the ideal combination of tutors, mentors, and projects to ensure the student’s success. Based on this analysis, a tailored program package is proposed.
							

            Parents or guardians can reserve a 45-minute virtual meeting via Google Meet to complete the CPA with a Ridgefield associate. All information collected is securely stored and used exclusively to create a personalized student program — it will not be used for any other purpose.

      <details>
  <summary><strong>Tutoring</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Our weekly tutoring sessions are flexible and personalized to each student's needs. Whether it's preparing for an upcoming exam or mastering a challenging concept, we provide targeted academic support exactly when it's needed most.
  </p>
  <p>
    When students aren't struggling with school material, our tutors go beyond the classroom by introducing advanced yet approachable math and science concepts that build the foundation to excel and stand out as future engineers in college.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each student is paired with real engineers or engineering students in fields that align with their goals, ensuring mentorship and academic guidance that’s both practical and inspiring.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pricing & Scheduling Options:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly Package:</strong> 4 one-hour sessions for <strong>$400/month</strong> (recommended for consistent progress and relationship building with tutor)</li>
    <li><strong>Flex Scheduling:</strong> Book individual one-hour sessions for <strong>$120/session</strong> — perfect for extra help or busy schedules</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Mentorship Program</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Our mentorship sessions are 90-minute, one-on-one workshops designed to connect students with professionals and top-performing students in the fields they aspire to enter. We carefully match each student with a mentor who has successfully navigated the path they aim to follow — providing authentic insight into what it takes to get there.
  </p>
  <p>
    During these sessions, mentors focus on understanding the student’s current position and goals, then create a personalized plan for growth. Topics often include college and internship applications, resume development, skill expansion, school selection, communication techniques, leadership building, and professional networking.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program is an excellent opportunity for students to sharpen their communication skills, refine their portfolios, and broaden their curiosity about real-world engineering and STEM careers.        
  </p>
  <p>
    Students may work with multiple mentors to expand their network, or stay with one mentor monthly to build a focused, long-term professional relationship.  
  </p>
  <p><strong>Pricing & Scheduling:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>$150 per 90-minute session</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Flexible scheduling:</strong> book as needed</li>
  </ul>

  <summary><strong>12–16 Week Engineering Project Program</strong></summary>
  <p>
    Our Project Program is an immersive, hands-on experience that equips students with the technical and professional skills needed to thrive in engineering school, research, and future careers. Students select from a curated list of real-world engineering projects (see full list <a href="projects.html"><strong>here</strong></a>) — the same kinds of challenges they’ll encounter in college, internships, and industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each student is matched with a dedicated Project Leader who meets with them twice per week (2 hours total) to provide technical guidance, feedback, and professional mentorship throughout the project. All required materials are fully provided by Ridgefield, ensuring every student can focus on learning and creating.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the course of 12–16 weeks, students gain experience with project planning, research, design, prototyping, testing, and presentation — all while building a portfolio of impressive work to showcase in college and internship applications. This program is ideal for students looking to deepen their engineering knowledge, develop critical thinking skills, and stand out as competitive candidates for top-tier programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the conclusion of the program, students present a Final Design Review — a professional-style presentation commonly used in the engineering field — to the Ridgefield Board and their parents. Successful completion earns the student a Ridgefield Certificate of Project Completion, a meaningful credential that validates their work and initiative.
  </p>
  <p>
    Project programs last 12–16 weeks, depending on the rigor of the selected project, and are sold as a full package. The current cost for a 12-week program is <strong>$2,500</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>  
    To support future success, each Project Leader remains an active reference who can attest to the student’s work and professionalism for internship or job opportunities — a powerful addition to any early engineering resume.
