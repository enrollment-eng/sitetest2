            <h2>Our Story & Mission</h2>
            <p style="color:#000000; max-width:900px; margin:auto;">
              Ridgefield Collegiate Engineering Prep was founded on the simple belief that students deserve authentic,
              hands-on engineering mentorship long before they step foot on a university campus.
              <br><br>
              What started as a small tutoring effort helping high-school students understand physics and coding has
              grown into a complete pre-college engineering program. Our mission is to bridge the gap between classroom
              theory and real-world problem-solving, giving every student the tools, confidence, and mindset of a true engineer.

                <strong>Rowan Quintero</strong> founded Ridgefield Collegiate Engineering Prep after years of mentoring students
                through university research programs and his solo tutoring business.
				<br><br>
				Rowan has been recognized throughout his undergraduate career for both his <a href="https://aero.umd.edu/news/story/umd-student-awarded-wings-foundation-scholarship">academic achievement</a> and his <a href="https://windtunnel.umd.edu/news/story/students-take-top-spots-at-aiaa-region-iii-student-conference">research work</a>. He has over two years of experience working as an aerospace engineer for the Department of Defense, and is now employed by the Federal Aviation Administration working on projects to revolutionize the National Aerospace System.

                <br><br>
                As an aerospace engineer specializing in hypersonic aerodynamics,
                Rowan saw how early technical experience, mentorship, and confidence can transform a student’s academic path.
                Ridgefield was built to replicate that opportunity — connecting aspiring engineers with real professionals
                who can guide them to reach their potential.
